Welcome to Marine Ecosystem Modelling (EcoMod) Group. I am a biogeochemical oceanographer interested in using models and statistical methods to better estimate and predict marine biogeochemical processes and support marine ecosystem management. [I currently work](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/#/faculty-personal-page?id=246) as an assistant professor in the [Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences) and an affiliate assistant professor in the [Department of Ocean Science](https://oces.hkust.edu.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home).

Biography
======
I got undergraduate training in Environmental Science at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) from 2007 to 2011, where I gained about 2 yearsâ€™ lab work experience in soil biogeochemistry. 

I went into the field of oceanography at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca) in 2012, working with [Dr. Katja Fennel](http://memg.ocean.dal.ca/fennel/) on ocean biogeochemistry and modeling. During my PhD, I received fellowship funding to visit the Data Assimilation Group led by [Dr. Laurent Bertino](https://www.nersc.no/staff/laurent-bertino) at Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, where I learned cutting-edge assimilation techniques to improve ocean model simulation. 

Upon graduation in 2019, I worked as a postdoc at HKUST with [Dr. Jianping Gan](https://odmp.ust.hk ) and got promoted to research assistant professor in 2020. I join HKUST(GZ) as a tenure-track assistant professor in July 2021.
