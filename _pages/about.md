Welcome to Marine Ecosystem Modelling (EcoMod) Group. I am a biogeochemical oceanographer interested in using models and statistical methods that combine observations and models to better estimate and predict marine biogeochemical processes and to support the management and sustainable development of marine ecosystems. [I currently work](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/#/faculty-personal-page?id=246) as an assistant professor in the [Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences) and an affiliate assistant professor in the [Department of Ocean Science](https://oces.hkust.edu.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home).

Biography
======
I got undergraduate training in Environmental Science at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) from 2007 to 2011, where I gained about 2 yearsâ€™ lab work experience in soil biogeochemistry. My undergraduate thesis work focused on soil carbon sequestration, with an emphasis on the effects of biochar application on soil greenhouse gas emissions. 

I went into the field of oceanography at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca) in 2012, working with [Dr. Katja Fennel](http://memg.ocean.dal.ca/fennel/) on ocean biogeochemistry and modeling. During my PhD, I received fellowship funding to visit the Data Assimilation Group led by [Dr. Laurent Bertino](https://www.nersc.no/staff/laurent-bertino) at Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, where I learned cutting-edge assimilation techniques to improve ocean model simulation. 

After graduation in November 2018, I worked as a postdoc at HKUST with [Dr. Jianping Gan](https://odmp.ust.hk ) and got promoted to research assistant professor in mid-2020. I join HKUST(GZ) as a tenure-track assistant professor in July 2021.
