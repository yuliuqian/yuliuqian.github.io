I work on ocean biogeochemistry and ecosystem modelling. I am passionate about using observations, models and statistical methods to improve the estimation and prediction of marine biogeochemical processes, and support management and sustainable development of marine ecosystems. 

I am currently an assistant professor in the  Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences Thrust at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)and an Affiliate Assistant Professor in the Department of Ocean Science at The Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.

Research interests
======
My primary research focus is to use biogeochemical models to investigate anthropogenic influences on marine ecosystems. I applied regional-scale numerical models to understand and predict pressing environmental issues, with previous work including seasonal hypoxia on the Louisiana Shelf, eutrophication and hypoxia off the Pearl River Estuary, and deep-sea oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The work involved developing and validating models of various configurations and levels of complexity to address different questions, such as isolating the role of physical and biogeochemical processes in coastal hypoxia formation, quantifying the relative contribution of riverine nutrient and organic matter to bottom water oxygen depletion, and estimating the microbial degradation rate of deep-water hydrocarbon plumes following the oil spill, among others.

I employ data assimilation techniques to improve model predictive capabilities and to optimize observing system designs. I have investigated the benefit of multivariate data assimilation method, the Ensemble Kalman Filter (EnKF), to simultaneously improve model estimated physical and biogeochemical ocean fields. I have also implemented the EnKF method in a Gulf of Mexico model to improve the simulated mesoscale circulation and the movement of deep-water hydrocarbon plumes. I have further utilized the data assimilation twin experiment framework to assess the observations sampling strategy adopted during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010 and propose optimized observing systems for more accurately tracking the movement of hydrocarbon plumes in future spill events.

I also use biogeochemical models to explore potential eco-engineering approaches for mitigating environmental problems. My recent interests involve investigating the prospect of incorporating shellfish aquaculture as a management tool to solve the problems of eutrophication and hypoxia. In particular, I have constructed an oyster aquaculture model to investigate the effectiveness of different oyster farming strategies on alleviating eutrophication and hypoxia off the Pearl River Estuary and its adjacent shelf. 


Biography
======
I got undergraduate training at Sun Yat-sen University from 2007 to 2011, where I had about 2 yearsâ€™ lab work in soil biogeochemistry. I went into the field of Oceanography at Dalhousie University in 2012, working with Dr. Katja Fennel on ocean biogeochemistry and modeling. During my PhD, I received fellowship funding to visit Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center in Norway, where I learnt cutting-edge data assimilation techniques to improve ocean model simulation. After graduation in November 2018, I started my postdoc at HKUST with Dr. Jianping Gan and got promoted to Research Assistant Professor in July 2020.
