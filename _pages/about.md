Welcome to Marine Ecosystem Modelling (EcoMod) Group. I am a biogeochemical oceanographer interested in using models and statistical methods that combine observations and models to better estimate and predict marine biogeochemical processes and to support the management and sustainable development of marine ecosystems. [I currently work](https://facultyprofiles.hkust-gz.edu.cn/#/faculty-personal-page?id=246) as an assistant professor in the [Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology (Guangzhou)](https://hkust-gz.edu.cn/academics/four-hubs/function-hub/earth-ocean-atmospheric-sciences) and an affiliate assistant professor in the [Department of Ocean Science](https://oces.hkust.edu.hk) at [Hong Kong University of Science and Technology](https://hkust.edu.hk/home).

**My primary research focus is to use biogeochemical models to investigate anthropogenic influences on marine ecosystems.** I apply regional-scale numerical models to understand and predict pressing environmental issues, with previous work including seasonal hypoxia on the Louisiana Shelf, eutrophication and hypoxia off the Pearl River Estuary, and deep-sea oil spill in the Gulf of Mexico. The work involves developing and validating models of various configurations and levels of complexity to address different questions.

**I employ data assimilation techniques (i.e., statistical methods that combine observations with models) to improve model predictive capabilities and to optimize observing system designs.** For example, the assimilation method has been implemented in a Gulf of Mexico model to improve the simulated movement of deep-water hydrocarbon plumes and assess the observations sampling strategy adopted during the Gulf of Mexico oil spill in 2010.

**I also use biogeochemical models to explore potential eco-engineering approaches for mitigating environmental problems.** My recent interests involve investigating the prospect of incorporating shellfish aquaculture as a management tool to solve the problems of eutrophication and hypoxia. 


Biography
======
I got undergraduate training in Environmental Science at [Sun Yat-sen University](http://www.sysu.edu.cn/en/index.htm) from 2007 to 2011, where I gained about 2 yearsâ€™ lab work experience in soil biogeochemistry. My undergraduate thesis work focused on soil carbon sequestration, with an emphasis on the effects of biochar application on soil greenhouse gas emissions. 

I went into the field of oceanography at [Dalhousie University](https://www.dal.ca) in 2012, working with [Dr. Katja Fennel](http://memg.ocean.dal.ca/fennel/) on ocean biogeochemistry and modeling. During my PhD, I received fellowship funding to visit the Data Assimilation Group led by [Dr. Laurent Bertino](https://www.nersc.no/staff/laurent-bertino) at Nansen Environmental and Remote Sensing Center, where I learned cutting-edge assimilation techniques to improve ocean model simulation. 

After graduation in November 2018, I worked as a postdoc at HKUST with [Dr. Jianping Gan](https://odmp.ust.hk ) and got promoted to research assistant professor in mid-2020. I join HKUST(GZ) as a tenure-track assistant professor in July 2021.
