We are looking for graduate students and post-doctoral associates with interdisciplinary interests and strong mathematical or quantitative backgrounds to join us. We also welcome undergraduate students and visiting scholars to collaborate on interdisciplinary research projects in the group. While our research heavily applies modelling techniques, coding/programming skill is a plus but not a must for prospective students to join the group. Please contact Liuqian Yu (liuqianyu@ust.hk) for more information.   

Additional information on the graduate program in the Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS) at HKUST(GZ) is also available in the flyer below.
