We are looking for graduate students and post-doctoral associates with interdisciplinary research interests to join us. We also welcome undergraduate students and visiting scholars to collaborate on research projects. While our work heavily applies modelling techniques, coding/programming skill is a plus but not a prerequisite for prospective members to join the group. Please contact Liuqian Yu (liuqianyu@hkust-gz.edu.cn) for more information.
