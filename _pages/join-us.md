We are looking for graduate students and post-doctoral associates with interdisciplinary research interests to join us. We also welcome undergraduate students and visiting scholars to collaborate on research projects with the group. While our work heavily applies modelling techniques, coding/programming skill is a plus but not a must for prospective group members. Please contact Liuqian Yu (liuqianyu@ust.hk) for more information.   

Additional information on the graduate program in the Thrust of Earth, Ocean and Atmospheric Sciences (EOAS) at HKUST(GZ) is also available in the flyer below.
